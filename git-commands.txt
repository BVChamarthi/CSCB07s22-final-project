clone remote repo to local directory: git clone https://github.com/BVChamarthi/CSCB07s22-final-project

if you already have a local repo and wnna be up to date, you need to pull the REMOTE repo to your LOCAL repo (do this before you start doing anything for the day):
git pull

moving to your own branch: git checkout <your branch>
      example: git checkout Bharath

getting stuff from another branch (after you've moved to your own branch): git checkout <other branch> <file names>(put a * or . if you need all the files)
      example: git checkout developer *

adding all the changes you've made to the LOCAL git repo: git add .

commiting all the changes to the LOCAL git repo: git commit -m "short descriptive message"

pushing all the changes from the LOCAL repo to YOUR branch in the REMOTE repo: git push -u origin <your branch>

What a day of work will look like:

pull from remote repo
move to YOUR branch
get all the files from the developer branch to your branch
do whatever
add, commit, and push to YOUR branch
tell me all the stuff you did, so I can compile them to the developer branch
